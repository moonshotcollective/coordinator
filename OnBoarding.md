Hey there!

We’re sending you this email because you’ve expressed interest in joining the Moonshot Collective. We LOVE that you’re interested and we’re always on the lookout for great people who have a passion for being on the cutting edge of public goods funding.

That’s why we want you to join us on a call THIS <> so you can learn more about what we’re up to, and how you might fit in.

The call will be hosted by some of our finest members, who will be there to talk through the various projects we’re working on, and to answer any questions you have. And in the meantime, check out moonshotcollective.space to familiarize yourself with the Moonshot Mission.

So join us this <>, at this link <>.

We look forward to seeing you then!
